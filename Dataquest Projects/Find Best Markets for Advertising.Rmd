title: "Find Best Markets for Advertising"
output: html_notebook

This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

This Notebook is focused on an e-commerce company who offers courses in programming. Most of them are in web and mobile development but some are focused on data science, game development, and others. With a new audience, the company is looking for the two best markets to advertise their diverse offering of products.

To properly assess which market would be best, a survey would provide the necessary information but that is costly and cheaper alternatives should be considered. As a result, using freeCodeCamp, an e-learning platform that offers web development courses, which has a survey that attracted a diversely interested set of new coders gives an ideal data set for the question.


```{r}
library(dplyr)
library(tidyr)
setwd("/Users/HerschelGupta/Documents/Dataquest/2017-new-coder-survey-master/clean-data") # Change this accordingly
survey <- read.csv("2017-fCC-New-Coders-Survey-Data.csv",
                   stringsAsFactors = FALSE) %>% tbl_df()
```

The package *dplyr* is loaded for efficient and effective dataframe manipulation. Accordingly, the data from the freeCodeCamp survey is read into the *survey* variable.

Before the data is analyzed, it needs to be determined that it is an accurate representation of the population in question. 

In the article that details the survey, it says that all the respondents are new to coding (< 5 years of experience) and after examining, there are columns that detail where the coders are located and how much free money they have to spend.

```{r}
summary <- survey %>% group_by(CountryLive) %>% summarize(`Free Money` = mean(MoneyForLearning,na.rm = TRUE),mean(MonthsProgramming,na.rm = TRUE)) %>% arrange(desc(`Free Money`)) %>% filter(CountryLive %in% c('United States of America','India','United Kingdom','Canada'))


finalists <- survey %>% drop_na(MoneyForLearning,MonthsProgramming) %>%
             mutate(MonthsProgramming = replace(MonthsProgramming,MonthsProgramming == 0,1)) %>%
             mutate(Per_month = MoneyForLearning/MonthsProgramming) %>%
             group_by(CountryLive) %>% 
             summarize(`Free Money` = mean(Per_month)) %>%
             filter(CountryLive %in% c('United States of America','India','United Kingdom','Canada'))
```
